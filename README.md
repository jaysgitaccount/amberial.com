Website for the game Amberial Dreams. The original repo didn't have a README, so I forked it to add my own.

## Notes
A website that I did for a client. Initially I was asked to implement an interface that displayed the game's featured levels, sourced from mod.io's REST API. However, I also offered to give the existing website an overall facelift, to bring it more in line with modern web trends. I wanted the website to speak to its users more, instead of just being a brochure.

At first I struggled a little bit with Tailwind, but I'm glad that I put in the effort to understand the thinking behind this framework. As part of the struggle, I gained a much better understanding of npm, and how to contextualise its usage in the general workflow of web development. I also feel much more confident about learning frameworks now. Also, my friends have told me Tailwind is controversial but after I understood it better I didn't mind using it!

I'm very happy with the result and I had a great time working on this project. I also received very positive feedback from the client!

### Skills practised
- Working with someone else's repository and adapting to existing practices and frameworks
- Using Fetch API, and communicating with REST APIs
- Learning by reading official documentation instead of Google results (especially for mod.io)
- Learned Tailwind CSS while working on this project
- Had a go at writing a YAML script (Github Actions) for CI/CD deployment to Github Pages
- Responsive design
- Writing tidy, legible and modular code
